            <p> My name is Benjamin Young and I am originally from Federal Way Washington. As a minor I was attracted to sports, photography and anything involving being outside. After high school I attended the University of Washington where developed a new passion towards technology and Real Estate. I graduated with a Bachelor degree in Urban Studies and went on to become a Real Estate Broker servicing the greater Seattle area. </p>
            <p>Currently I have been a real estate broker for over seven years and developed a successful career within the industry. After being in the industry for multiple years I noticed my growth has seem to plateau. I now desire to explore my passion for technology and see if I can merge the two industries in a life long career thus is why I decided to join the Full-Stack Boot camp hosted by the University of Washington. </p>
